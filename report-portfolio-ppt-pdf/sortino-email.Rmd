```{r calculations}
```

## Hello Team,

Here is the daily pulse of the `r PORT` Portfolio as of `r Sys.Date()`.


```{r scatter, include=FALSE}
```

`r add_ggplot(portfolio_scatter, width = 4, height = 4)`

The returns as of `r Sys.Date()`: 

```{r density, include=FALSE}
```

`r add_ggplot(sortino_density_plot, width = 4, height = 4)`

Here are the raw numbers. A spreadsheet and powerpoint deck are attached:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
  
sign_formatter <- formatter("span", 
  style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(x > 0, "green", 
    ifelse(x < 0, "red", "black"))))


tbl <- 
  portfolio_selected %>%
  arrange(desc(date)) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  format_table(x = .,
               list(returns = sign_formatter))

tbl

```
